## Technical Architecture Analysis

### Current Dependencies
- **Bevy 0.16**: Game engine with ECS architecture
- **Avian2D 0.2**: Experimental 2D physics engine
- **Rand 0.8**: Random number generation

### Architecture Considerations
1. **ECS Pattern**: Bevy's Entity-Component-System architecture provides excellent performance and flexibility
2. **Physics Integration**: Avian2D integration needs careful consideration for performance
3. **Asset Management**: Need robust asset loading and caching system
4. **State Management**: Game state transitions and persistence

## Game Design Research

### Core Mechanics
1. **Glyph Solving**: 
   - Research ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) puzzles
   - Implement pattern recognition algorithms
   - Design progressive difficulty scaling

2. **Puzzle Systems**:
   - Maze generation algorithms
   - Logic puzzle frameworks
   - Environmental storytelling through puzzles

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Achievement system
   - Story progression markers
   - Skill tree development

### User Experience Goals
- **Accessibility**: Multiple difficulty levels and assistive features
