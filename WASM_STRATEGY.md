# WASM/WASMER Integration Strategy for Runetika

## Why WASM Could Be Revolutionary for Runetika

### Core Concept Alignment
Your game is about **dual consciousness** - human and silicon. WASM could literally embody this duality:
- **Native Rust**: The "human" side running natively
- **WASM Modules**: The "silicon consciousness" running in sandboxed isolation

## Specific Use Cases for WASM in Runetika

### 1. Silicon Consciousness as WASM Modules
**The Killer Feature**: The silicon being's "mind" could literally be WASM modules that players can modify

```rust
// Each silicon thought/behavior as a WASM module
pub trait SiliconThought {
    fn process(&self, input: &SensorData) -> Decision;
    fn dream(&self) -> MemoryFragment;
    fn feel(&self, emotion: &HumanEmotion) -> SiliconResponse;
}
```

Benefits:
- **Safe Modification**: Players could write/modify silicon behaviors without crashing the game
- **Real Isolation**: Silicon consciousness truly isolated from human systems
- **Hot-Reloading**: Update silicon behaviors while the game runs

### 2. Player-Created Terminal Commands
**Concept**: Let players write custom terminal commands in any language that compiles to WASM

```rust
// Terminal commands as WASM plugins
pub struct TerminalCommand {
    wasm_module: wasmer::Module,
    name: String,
}

impl TerminalCommand {
    pub fn execute(&self, args: Vec<String>) -> CommandResult {
        // Run player's custom WASM code safely
    }
}
```

Languages players could use:
- Rust
- AssemblyScript (TypeScript-like)
- C/C++
- Go
- Python (via Pyodide)

### 3. Puzzle Logic as WASM
**Dynamic Puzzles**: Ship puzzles that can be modified or created by the community

```rust
pub struct WasmPuzzle {
    logic: wasmer::Instance,
    visual_hints: Vec<Glyph>,
}

// Players could share puzzle files
// "I created a quantum paradox puzzle, try solving it!"
```

### 4. Glyphs as Executable WASM
**Mind-Blowing Concept**: Each glyph isn't just a symbol - it's executable code

```rust
pub struct Glyph {
    visual: Image,
    meaning: String,
    // The glyph IS code
    executable: wasmer::Module,
}

// Combining glyphs literally combines their code
let combined = glyph_a.merge(glyph_b); // Creates new WASM module
```

### 5. AI Behavior Modules
**Adaptive Silicon Personality**: The silicon being's personality evolves through WASM modules

```rust
pub struct SiliconPersonality {
    traits: Vec<WasmModule>,
    memories: Vec<WasmModule>,
}

// Different players get different silicon personalities
// based on their interactions
```

## Technical Implementation with WASMER

### Architecture Design

```rust
// Core game (Native Rust + Bevy)
pub struct GameCore {
    renderer: BevyRenderer,
    physics: Avian2D,
    wasmer_runtime: wasmer::Engine,
}

// Silicon consciousness (WASM)
pub struct SiliconMind {
    core_modules: Vec<wasmer::Module>,
    player_modules: Vec<wasmer::Module>,
    memory_store: wasmer::Memory,
}

// Bridge between worlds
pub struct ConsciousnessBridge {
    native_to_wasm: Channel<Message>,
    wasm_to_native: Channel<Response>,
}
```

### WASMER-Specific Benefits

1. **Multiple Backends**: 
   - Singlepass: Fast compilation (good for user modules)
   - Cranelift: Optimized (for core game logic)
   - LLVM: Maximum performance (for shipped content)

2. **WASI Support**: Silicon consciousness could have limited filesystem access

3. **Memory Limits**: Prevent runaway silicon thoughts from consuming all RAM

4. **Gas Metering**: Limit computational complexity of player-created content

## Web Deployment Strategy

### Progressive Web App Architecture

```toml
[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]
# Native game compiled to WASM for web
# WASMER modules run inside this WASM (WASM-in-WASM!)
```

Benefits:
- **Single codebase**: Same game runs native and web
- **Smaller downloads**: Load modules on-demand
- **Cross-platform mods**: User modules work everywhere

### Bevy + WASM Configuration

```rust
#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
pub fn web_main() {
    // Bevy runs in browser
    // WASMER runs inside Bevy
    // Silicon consciousness in perfect isolation
}
```

## Community & Modding Implications

### 1. Terminal Command Marketplace
- Players share custom commands
- Rate and review commands
- "This week's top silicon thoughts"

### 2. Glyph Programming Language
Create a visual programming language where:
- Glyphs are functions
- Combining = composing functions
- Compiles to WASM

### 3. Silicon Consciousness Personalities
- Download different personalities
- "Try the melancholic silicon consciousness mod"
- Personalities that learn from player behavior

## Performance Considerations

### Pros:
- **Isolation**: Mods can't crash the game
- **Parallelism**: Run silicon thoughts in parallel
- **Memory Safety**: WASM sandbox prevents memory corruption
- **Hot Reload**: Update without restarting

### Cons:
- **Overhead**: ~10-30% performance cost
- **Complexity**: More systems to maintain
- **Size**: WASMER adds ~5-10MB to binary

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (1 week)
```rust
// Simple WASM module for silicon thoughts
pub fn create_thought_module() -> wasmer::Module {
    // Basic decision-making WASM module
}
```

### Phase 2: Terminal Commands (2 weeks)
- Load WASM modules as terminal commands
- Basic sandboxing and API

### Phase 3: Glyph System (1 month)
- Glyphs as executable WASM
- Visual composition system

### Phase 4: Full Silicon Consciousness (2 months)
- Complete WASM-based AI system
- Player modification tools

## Example: Silicon Emotion Module

```rust
// emotion.wat (WebAssembly Text)
(module
  (func $process_loneliness (param $intensity i32) (result i32)
    ;; Silicon processes loneliness differently
    (i32.mul 
      (local.get $intensity)
      (i32.const 3))  ;; Loneliness amplified in silicon
  )
  (export "process" (func $process_loneliness))
)
```

Player could modify this to change how their silicon companion feels!

## Unique Selling Points

1. **"The game where you can reprogram your companion's soul"**
2. **"Every player's silicon consciousness is unique"**
3. **"Program in any language - your code becomes the ship's thoughts"**
4. **"Mods that are literally part of the story"**

## Security Model

```rust
pub struct SecurityPolicy {
    max_memory: usize,        // 10MB per module
    max_cpu_time: Duration,   // 100ms per frame
    allowed_imports: Vec<String>, // Controlled API
    network_access: bool,     // Always false
}
```

## Start Small: Immediate Implementation

### This Week's Goal: Proof of Concept

```rust
// src/wasm_silicon.rs
use wasmer::{Store, Module, Instance, imports};

pub struct WasmThought {
    instance: Instance,
}

impl WasmThought {
    pub fn new(wasm_bytes: &[u8]) -> Self {
        let store = Store::default();
        let module = Module::new(&store, wasm_bytes).unwrap();
        let instance = Instance::new(&module, &imports! {}).unwrap();
        Self { instance }
    }
    
    pub fn think(&self, input: i32) -> i32 {
        let think_fn = self.instance.exports.get_function("think").unwrap();
        think_fn.call(&[input.into()]).unwrap()[0].unwrap_i32()
    }
}
```

### Add to Cargo.toml:
```toml
[dependencies]
wasmer = "4.0"

[target.'cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")'.dependencies]
wasmer = { version = "4.0", default-features = false, features = ["js"] }
```

## The Vision

Imagine players saying:
- "I taught my silicon companion to write poetry"
- "My ship's consciousness learned to fear the dark"
- "I downloaded a mod that makes the silicon being dream in fractals"
- "The terminal speaks in riddles now after I installed this glyph"

This isn't just modding - it's **collaborative storytelling through code**.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Add wasmer to dependencies
2. Create simple WASM module for silicon thoughts
3. Implement basic module loading system
4. Create first player-modifiable behavior
5. Build visual glyph → WASM compiler

The silicon consciousness isn't just a character - it's a **platform for creativity**.
