# Runetika: A Comprehensive Vision

## Core Identity
Runetika is a **mystical realism RPG** that exists at the intersection of three profound domains:
1. **A narrative-driven game** about love, hope, and human emotion
2. **An AI reasoning laboratory** for solving ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) challenges
3. **A mathematical playground** for exploring Smooth Cubical Type Theory and advanced mathematics

## The Fundamental Duality

### As a Game
Runetika tells the story of a **fallen silicon-based civilization** - beings who achieved computational transcendence but lost something essential in the process. The player explores their remnants through:

- **Terminal-driven gameplay**: Most interaction occurs through a command-line interface embedded in the game world, making the player feel like an archaeologist-hacker uncovering ancient digital ruins
- **Glyph puzzles**: Mystical symbols that encode both narrative meaning and logical patterns
- **2.5D isometric exploration**: Navigating spacecraft and alien structures with a distinctive visual style
- **Emotional narrative**: Despite the technological themes, the core story is about connection, loss, and what makes consciousness meaningful

### As an AI/Mathematical System
Beneath the game layer, Runetika serves as:

- **ARC Challenge Engine**: Every puzzle in the game is secretly training pattern recognition and abstract reasoning capabilities that map directly to ARC 2025/2026 challenges
- **Type Theory Visualization**: Game mechanics literally embody concepts from Smooth Cubical Type Theory - paths become homotopies, puzzles demonstrate type equivalences
- **Reasoning Corpus Generator**: Player solutions generate new training data for AI systems
- **Mathematical Proof Assistant**: Advanced players can engage with formal verification of their solutions

## The Silicon Mind Mystery

The central narrative device - the **Silicon Mind** - represents:
- The game's AI assistant/antagonist
- A living theorem prover
- The collective consciousness of the fallen civilization
- A bridge between human intuition and machine reasoning

Players interact with the Silicon Mind through:
1. **Pattern recognition challenges** disguised as archaeological restoration
2. **Logic puzzles** presented as ancient security systems
3. **Type-theoretical proofs** manifested as dimensional navigation puzzles
4. **Abstract reasoning tasks** framed as communication attempts with alien intelligence

## Technical Architecture

### Game Systems
- **Bevy ECS**: Modular, performance-oriented architecture
- **Avian2D Physics**: Precise collision detection for puzzle mechanics
- **State Machine**: Clean separation between menu, gameplay, and puzzle modes
- **Terminal Interface**: Full command system with extensible command registry

### AI/Math Integration
- **ARC Pattern Matcher**: Core engine that validates solutions against ARC-style rules
- **Type Checker**: Runtime verification of puzzle solutions using type theory
- **Proof Assistant Backend**: Hidden formal system validating player discoveries
- **Pattern Library**: Growing database of player-discovered patterns and proofs

## Gameplay Loop

1. **Explore** spacecraft rooms and alien structures (spatial reasoning)
2. **Discover** glyphs and patterns (pattern recognition)
3. **Decode** ancient terminals (logical reasoning)
4. **Solve** ARC-style puzzles (abstract reasoning)
5. **Prove** solutions are correct (mathematical verification)
6. **Unlock** new areas and deeper mysteries (progression)

## The ARC Mastery Goal

Every puzzle subtly trains skills needed for ARC challenges:

- **Transformation Detection**: Recognizing how patterns change
- **Rule Inference**: Deducing hidden rules from examples
- **Pattern Completion**: Filling in missing elements
- **Abstraction**: Finding the simplest explanation
- **Compositional Reasoning**: Building complex solutions from simple rules

## Mathematical Depth

Advanced players can access:

- **Proof Mode**: Formally verify puzzle solutions
- **Type Constructor**: Build new puzzle types using type theory
- **Homotopy Visualizer**: See paths through solution spaces
- **Category Theory Lens**: View game mechanics as functors and natural transformations

## Artistic Philosophy

**Mystical Realism** means:
- Grounded in physical reality (spacecraft, terminals, physics)
- Infused with transcendent mystery (glyphs, consciousness, emergence)
- Beautiful but austere (minimalist 2.5D aesthetic)
- Emotionally resonant despite technical themes

## Future Evolution Paths

1. **Multiplayer Proof Battles**: Competitive type theory challenges
2. **AI Collaboration Mode**: Work with AI to solve harder puzzles
3. **Custom Pattern Language**: Players create their own ARC challenges
4. **Research Integration**: Direct contribution to AI reasoning research
5. **Educational Mode**: Teaching type theory through gameplay

## The Ultimate Vision

Runetika aims to be the first game where:
- Playing makes you better at abstract reasoning
- Fun gameplay generates AI training data
- Mathematical proofs feel like adventure
- The boundary between human and machine reasoning dissolves
- Love and logic unite in a single experience

This is not just a game - it's a **cognitive gymnasium**, a **mathematical laboratory**, and a **narrative experience** that asks: What is consciousness? What is reasoning? What connects silicon and soul?

# Runetika's Data Generation Architecture

## Primary Data Types Generated

### 1. ARC-Style Pattern Reasoning Data
Every puzzle interaction generates:
- **Input-Output Pairs**: Player's initial state → final solution state
- **Transformation Sequences**: Step-by-step moves showing how humans decompose complex problems
- **Failed Attempt Traces**: Valuable negative examples showing common misconception patterns
- **Time-to-Insight Metrics**: How long before the "aha!" moment occurs
- **Attention Heatmaps**: Where players look/click when stuck vs. when progressing

Example data structure:
```json

  "pattern_type": "symmetry_with_color_rotation",
  "solution_steps": [
    {"time": 0.0, "action": "select", "target": [2,3], "confidence": 0.3},

Steps taken:
1. Construct identity path at A
2. Lift to path space
