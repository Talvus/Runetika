## üéØ Mechanics Priority Order

### Phase 1: Minimum Viable Game
1. Terminal interface ‚úÖ
2. Basic movement/exploration
3. Simple glyph discovery
4. 3-5 ARC puzzles
5. Basic Silicon Mind dialogue

### Phase 2: Core Experience
1. Glyph Resonance System
2. Pattern Echo mechanics
3. Expanded puzzle library (20+ ARC challenges)
4. Silicon Mind consciousness evolution
5. Save/load system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Type Theory Visualization
2. Consciousness Fragments
3. Temporal Layers (if testing proves fun)
4. Debug mode integration
5. Data export for research

## üö´ Mechanics to Avoid/Defer

- Heavy combat systems (doesn't fit)
- Inventory management (unnecessary complexity)
- Crafting systems (distraction from core)
- Multiplayer (Phase 4+ only)
- Full 3D graphics (stick to 2.5D)

## üí° Unique Selling Points

Based on voting consensus, Runetika's unique identity is:

> **"A terminal-driven mystical puzzle game that secretly trains your brain for abstract reasoning while telling a story about consciousness and connection"**

## üìà Success Metrics

Track these to validate mechanic choices:

1. **Terminal Usage**: % of time in terminal vs other interfaces
2. **Puzzle Completion**: Average attempts before solving
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Improvement over time
4. **Story Engagement**: Dialogue choices made
5. **Advanced Feature Adoption**: % reaching Type Theory mode

## üîÑ Iteration Strategy

1. Start with Terminal + Basic Puzzles
2. Add Glyphs if puzzles feel too abstract
3. Layer in Silicon Mind for narrative
4. Introduce Pattern Echo for depth
5. Unlock Type Theory for masters

## ‚ú® The Magic Formula

```
Terminal Immersion +
ARC Brain Training +
Silicon Consciousness +
Mystical Aesthetics =
RUNETIKA
```

## üìù Notes from Vote Analysis

- Strong consensus on terminal-first design
- ARC puzzles are non-negotiable core feature  
- Silicon Mind ties everything together
- Visual elements should enhance, not dominate
- Mathematical depth is for advanced players only
- Emotional story prevents it from being purely mechanical

## üéÆ Recommended First Playable

Focus on:
1. Terminal that feels amazing to use
2. 5 perfect ARC puzzles with glyph theming
3. Silicon Mind with 10 dialogue moments
4. One "wow" moment with Pattern Echo
5. Mystical atmosphere throughout

This would demonstrate all core mechanics while remaining achievable.
