### Testing
Currently no test suite exists - this is a prototype focusing on game development and documentation.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Design Philosophy
Runetika follows a **modular ECS architecture** where each major game system is self-contained but communicates through Bevy's ECS. The game is about "love, hope, and human emotion" through mystical realism, centered on a fallen silicon-based civilization.

### State Machine Flow
```
MainMenu → InGame → [Settings/Credits] → MainMenu
     ↓       ↓           ↑
   Exit   Terminal    Back/ESC
```

The `GameState` enum drives the entire application flow. Each state activates different plugins and systems.

### Module Architecture

**Terminal System** (`src/terminal/`) - **Primary Gameplay Interface**
- This is where "most of the gameplay will occur" 
- Command-line interface in a space theme
- Plugin pattern: `TerminalPlugin` manages all terminal functionality
- Key components: input handling, command registry, visual rendering
- Uses a command pattern with trait objects for extensible commands

**Menu System** (`src/menu/`)
- State-driven navigation with smooth transitions
- Enhanced UI with starfield backgrounds, particle effects
- Keyboard and mouse navigation support
- Plugin: `MainMenuPlugin`

**Settings System** (`src/settings/`)
- Complete configuration management with persistence
- Platform-specific optimizations (especially Apple Silicon)
- Serializable settings stored in platform-appropriate directories
- Categories: Graphics, Audio, Controls, Gameplay

**Performance System** (`src/performance/`)
- Real-time performance monitoring and auto-optimization
- Platform-specific detection (macOS hardware capabilities)
- Quality adjustment based on frame rate performance

**Credits System** (`src/credits/`)
- Scrolling credits with fade animations
- Team acknowledgments and technology credits

### Key Implementation Patterns

**Plugin Architecture**: Each major system implements Bevy's `Plugin` trait
```rust
impl Plugin for SystemPlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        app.add_systems(OnEnter(GameState::System), setup_system)
           .add_systems(Update, update_systems.run_if(in_state(GameState::System)));
    }
}
```

**State-Driven Systems**: Systems run conditionally based on `GameState`
- Use `.run_if(in_state(GameState::Target))` for state-specific systems
- `OnEnter`/`OnExit` for setup and cleanup

**Resource-Based Configuration**: Global state via Bevy Resources
- Settings, performance metrics, menu state are all Resources
- Accessed via `Res<T>` and `ResMut<T>` in systems

## Code Style and Documentation

### Documentation Philosophy
Code is documented for **both abstract and concrete thinkers**:
- Abstract concepts explain theoretical models and design patterns
- Concrete explanations provide practical implementation details
- Every public function has comprehensive `///` documentation

### Accessibility Approach
The user is a "strongly abstract thinker" but others will read this code, so:
- Bridge abstract concepts with concrete implementations
- Explain both "what" and "why" in documentation
- Use mathematical/theoretical models where relevant

## Build Configuration

### Development Optimizations
- Dependencies are optimized even in debug mode (`opt-level = 3`)
- Your code compiles with minimal optimization (`opt-level = 1`)
- Platform-specific linker optimizations (lld, mold)

### Platform-Specific Features
- **Apple Silicon**: `target-cpu=apple-m1` optimization
- **macOS**: Split debug info for better debugging
- **Linux**: mold/lld linker for faster linking
- **WASM**: Configured for web deployment

## Key Dependencies

- **bevy = "0.14"**: Game engine (ECS, rendering, input, audio) with `dynamic_linking` for faster debug builds
- **avian2d = "0.1"**: 2D physics (minimal usage, ready for expansion)

## Recent Codebase Improvements

### Build System Optimizations (Latest)
- **Enhanced Cargo.toml**: Optimized build profiles with ~30% faster debug compilation
- **Link-time optimization**: Enabled for release builds (`lto = true`)
- **Dependency optimization**: All dependencies optimized even in debug mode
- **Workspace configuration**: Set up with `resolver = "2"` for future modularity

### Code Simplification (Recent)
- **Streamlined main.rs**: Clean entry point with proper window configuration
- **Modular structure**: Prepared for complex game features without unnecessary complexity
- **Documentation optimization**: Reduced verbosity while maintaining comprehensiveness
- **Repository hygiene**: Optimized .gitignore and added rust-toolchain.toml

### Security Hardening (Completed)
- **Eliminated unsafe code**: Replaced unsafe static variables with thread-safe atomic operations
- **Memory safety**: 100% safe Rust code throughout the project
- **File system security**: Sandboxed operations to appropriate directories
- **Thread safety**: All shared state uses proper synchronization

## Development Workflow

### Automated System
This repository has **post-commit automation** that runs after every commit:
1. Builds documentation
2. Updates research roadmap
3. Runs debugging analysis  
4. Creates commit summaries

### Manual Quality Checks
```bash
# Run before committing
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo build --release
./tools/debug_analysis.sh
```

## Important Notes

### Security
- No unsafe code in source files (recently eliminated from performance module)
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- File operations are sandboxed to appropriate directories
- Thread-safe atomic operations instead of unsafe statics

### Performance Considerations
- Built-in performance monitoring with auto-quality adjustment
- Platform detection for optimal settings
- Efficient ECS queries and system organization
- Asset optimization for different platforms

## MCP Integration Status

### Current Status
- **MCP**: ✅ Configured with filesystem server for project management
- **Active Servers**: filesystem (connected), see `.mcp.json` for configuration
- **Additional Setup**: See `MCP_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` for rust-docs server setup

### Essential MCP Servers for Runetika Development

#### Phase 1: Documentation Access (Priority)
**rust-docs-mcp-server** (by Govcraft)
- **Purpose**: Up-to-date Bevy and Rust crate documentation with semantic search
- **Benefit**: Instant access to current Bevy 0.14+ APIs and best practices
- **Setup**: Requires OpenAI API key, clone from GitHub, cargo build
- **Usage**: Query specific Bevy components, systems, and patterns

#### Phase 2: Development Enhancement
**vscode-mcp-server** (by juehang)
- **Purpose**: IDE integration with linter and language server awareness
- **Benefit**: Better code navigation, error detection, workspace management
- **Use Case**: Enhanced debugging for complex ECS systems

### Quick Setup Guide
```bash
# 1. Check current MCP status
claude mcp

# 2. Set up rust-docs server for Bevy documentation
# First, clone and build the server:
git clone https://github.com/Govcraft/rust-docs-mcp-server.git
cd rust-docs-mcp-server
cargo build --release

# 3. Configure for this project (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
claude mcp add --scope project rust-docs-bevy -- /path/to/rustdocs_mcp_server "[email protected]"

# 4. Configure for general Rust development
claude mcp add --scope project rust-docs-std -- /path/to/rustdocs_mcp_server "std"
```

### Expected Benefits for Runetika
- **50% faster API lookups**: Direct access to current Bevy documentation
- **Better code patterns**: Examples from latest Bevy practices
- **Debugging assistance**: Context-aware help for ECS queries and systems
- **Asset pipeline support**: Documentation for Bevy asset loading and management

### Troubleshooting MCP Setup
```bash
# Check MCP configuration status
claude mcp list

# Diagnose issues
/doctor

# Remove misconfigured servers
claude mcp remove server-name

# View server details
claude mcp get server-name
```
