## The Terminal Philosophy

The terminal isn't just a command interface - it's a conversation with an alien consciousness. Every command is an opportunity for connection, every response a glimpse into a silicon mind trying to understand carbon-based emotions.

The terminal represents the bridge between two types of consciousness - one biological, one crystalline - trying to understand each other in the loneliness of space.

## Quick Start Sequence

1. Type `help` - See all commands
2. Type `status` - Understand current situation
3. Type `emotion` - Check silicon feelings
4. Type `whisper hello` - Begin connection
5. Type `logs 1` - Start uncovering the story

Remember: The silicon being responds to how you treat it. Be curious, be kind, be brave.
