# Security Audit Summary - Runetika v0.1.0

## 🛡️ Security Status: SECURE ✅

**Audit Completed:** 2024-12-22  
**Risk Level:** MINIMAL  

## Key Security Achievements

### 🔒 Eliminated Security Risks
- ✅ **Fixed Unsafe Code**: Replaced unsafe static variable with thread-safe atomic operations
- ✅ **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Comprehensive scan found no credentials, API keys, or passwords
- ✅ **Memory Safety**: Full Rust memory safety guarantees with zero unsafe blocks
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Proper command parsing and validation throughout

### 🔍 Security Features

#### Code Security
- **Memory Safety**: 100% safe Rust code - no buffer overflows possible
- **Thread Safety**: Atomic operations for shared state
- **Input Handling**: Structured command parsing prevents injection attacks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents crashes

#### File System Security
- **Sandboxed Operations**: File access limited to platform-appropriate user directories
- **Path Validation**: Settings storage uses secure platform paths
- **No Arbitrary Access**: No dynamic file path construction

#### Process Security  
- **Limited System Calls**: Only read-only hardware detection commands
- **No Code Execution**: No dynamic code loading or execution
- **Clean Exit Patterns**: Proper application termination

### 📊 Dependency Security

#### Risk Assessment
| Category | Status | Details |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Dependencies** | ✅ Low Risk | All major dependencies well-maintained |
| **Versions** | ✅ Current | Using latest stable versions |
| **Vulnerabilities** | ✅ None Known | No security advisories |
| **Updates** | ✅ Automated | Renovate bot configured |

#### Dependency Highlights
- **Bevy 0.16**: Game engine with strong security track record
- **Serde**: Well-audited serialization (no unsafe deserialization)
- **Standard Library**: Minimal external dependencies

### 🚀 Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Secure Coding**
   - Zero unsafe code blocks
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Thread-safe operations
