# Security Audit Report - Runetika v0.1.0

**Audit Date:** 2024-12-22  
**Audited By:** Claude Code Assistant  
**Repository:** OurRunetika  
**Commit Range:** Initial codebase analysis  

## Executive Summary

The Runetika codebase demonstrates good security practices overall. Most security concerns are minor and follow standard Rust safety patterns. The codebase shows defensive programming practices and proper error handling in most areas.

**Risk Level: LOW** ‚úÖ

## Detailed Findings

### üü° Minor Security Concerns

#### 1. Unsafe Code Usage
**Location:** `src/performance/mod.rs:248-285`  
**Issue:** Static mutable variable accessed without proper synchronization  
**Risk:** Low - Race condition potential in multi-threaded environment

```rust
static mut LAST_ADJUSTMENT: f32 = 0.0;
```

**Recommendation:** Replace with atomic operations or a Mutex:
```rust
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicU64, Ordering};
static LAST_ADJUSTMENT: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);
```

#### 2. System Command Execution
**Location:** `src/settings/systems.rs:77-88`  
**Issue:** Executing system commands for hardware detection  
**Risk:** Low - Limited to read-only system information

```rust
let output = Command::new("sysctl")
    .arg("-n")
    .arg("machdep.cpu.brand_string")
    .output();
```

**Assessment:** Acceptable - Commands are hardcoded and read-only.

#### 3. Process Exit Calls
**Locations:** 
- `src/terminal/commands.rs` 
- `src/menu/systems.rs`

**Issue:** Direct process termination  
**Risk:** Low - Standard game exit patterns

**Assessment:** Normal game behavior - proper cleanup should be ensured.

### ‚úÖ Security Strengths

#### 1. No Hardcoded Secrets
- ‚úÖ No API keys, passwords, or tokens found in source code
- ‚úÖ No database connection strings
- ‚úÖ No authentication credentials

#### 2. Input Handling
- ‚úÖ Terminal input appears to be properly parsed
- ‚úÖ No SQL injection vectors (no database usage)
- ‚úÖ Command parsing uses structured approach

#### 3. File System Operations
- ‚úÖ Settings persistence uses platform-appropriate directories
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling for file operations
- ‚úÖ No arbitrary file system access

#### 4. Memory Safety
- ‚úÖ Minimal unsafe code usage
- ‚úÖ Rust's ownership system prevents most memory vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ No buffer overflow potential identified

#### 5. Network Security
- ‚úÖ No network operations in current codebase
- ‚úÖ No external API calls
- ‚úÖ No data transmission

### üîç Dependency Analysis

#### Current Dependencies Risk Assessment

| Dependency | Version | Risk Level | Notes |
|------------|---------|------------|--------|
| bevy | 0.16 | Low | Actively maintained game engine |
| avian2d | 0.2 | Low | Physics engine, no network exposure |
| rand | 0.8 | Low | Standard random number generation |
| serde | 1.0 | Low | Well-audited serialization library |
| dirs | 5.0 | Low | Platform directory detection |

**Duplicate Dependencies:** ‚úÖ Identified but acceptable  
Multiple versions of some dependencies exist due to Bevy's dual-version usage (0.15.1 and 0.16.1). This is expected during framework transitions.

#### Recommendations for Production

1. **Enable Security Audits**
   ```bash
   cargo install cargo-audit
   cargo audit
   ```

2. **Regular Dependency Updates**
   - Renovate bot is already configured ‚úÖ
   - Security updates are prioritized ‚úÖ

### üìã Security Checklist

#### Development Practices
- [x] No hardcoded secrets
- [x] Proper error handling
- [x] Input validation where applicable
- [x] Platform-appropriate file operations
- [x] Minimal unsafe code
- [x] Dependencies regularly updated

#### Runtime Security
- [x] No network exposure in current version
- [x] File operations limited to user directories
- [x] No arbitrary code execution
- [x] Memory safety via Rust guarantees
- [ ] **TODO:** Replace unsafe static with thread-safe alternative

#### Future Considerations
- [ ] When adding network features, implement proper TLS
- [ ] Add input sanitization for future user-generated content
- [ ] Consider security headers if web version planned
- [ ] Implement secure save game format if needed

## Remediation Plan

### Priority 1 (Low Risk)
1. **Fix Unsafe Static Variable**
   - Replace `static mut LAST_ADJUSTMENT` with atomic operations
   - Timeline: Next development cycle

### Priority 2 (Enhancement)
1. **Add Cargo Audit to CI/CD**
   - Automated security scanning
   - Timeline: Future automation setup

2. **Document Security Practices**
   - Security guidelines for contributors
   - Timeline: Before external contributions

## Conclusion

The Runetika codebase demonstrates strong security fundamentals with minimal risk. The identified issues are minor and typical for game development. The use of Rust provides excellent memory safety guarantees, and the codebase follows defensive programming practices.

**Overall Security Rating: GOOD** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ

### Recommendations Summary

1. **Immediate:** Fix the unsafe static variable usage
2. **Short-term:** Add automated security audits
3. **Long-term:** Maintain security practices as features expand
