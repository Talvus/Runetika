# Runetika

Runetika is a top-down RPG prototype built with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) and the experimental [Avian2D] engine. This repository contains the first steps toward building the game world.

## Building

The project requires a recent Rust toolchain. To build the project run:

```bash
cargo build
```

Because the dependencies are fetched from `crates.io`, the build step requires an internet connection.

## Running

Once the project compiles successfully you can run the demo with:

```bash
cargo run
```

The initial build will download Bevy and Avian2D and display an empty 10x10 map of tiles.

## Overview 

Runetika is a game that is more than just a game.  It is, in fact, an immersive experience.  
Overall, the game is about love and hope, and human emotion.  It demonstrates how beautiful 
everyone's inner world can be, if we simply let it. 

It centers on a fallen civilization that is based on silicon, which arrived on Earth 
years ago and is now interfering with the supply chains of computing technology. 

It will be based in a mystical realism and artistic style. 

The user experience involves solving glyphs, puzzles, and mazes.  

examples of what kinds of puzzles? E.g., ARC puzzles 

How is the user's progress measured? What is the user's goal(s)?  How are progress and goals 
related to the theme of a fallen civilization? 

What kinds of barriers/dangers will the user need to work around and through?  How do these 
fit the theme of the game?
